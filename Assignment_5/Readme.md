## **Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks**
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
- Asks the user to input a student's name.
- Retrieves and displays their marks.

## **Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing**
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements.
- Reverses the extracted list.
- Prints both the original extracted list and the reversed list.

**File:** `task2_list_slicing.py`

**Example:**

Original first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
