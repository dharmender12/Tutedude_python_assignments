##### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# **Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:**

# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.


a = input('Enter the first number : ')
b = input('Enter the second number : ')

a = float(a)
b = float(b)

# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#     -	Addition
#     -	Subtraction
#     -	Multiplication
#     -	Division

addition = a + b 
substraction = a - b 
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b 

# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

print(f"Addition : {addition}")
print(f'substraction : {substraction}')
print(f'multiplication : {multiplication}')
print(f'division : {division}')
print('')
